		<videosynposis><![CDATA[â€œLâ€™Attesaâ€ (â€œThe Waitâ€), Piero Messinaâ€™s debut feature, is an elegant melodrama of maternal grief with overtones of horror, a psychological rather than a supernatural ghost story. Set in Sicily around Easter, the film partakes freely of religious imagery to add gravity and mystery to its domestic tale of loss, longing and deceit. The landscape â€” volcanic rock and quiet forests surrounding a sparkling lake â€” is captured in long, wide takes, a beauty surpassed story only by close-ups of the two lead actresses, Juliette Binoche and Lou de LaÃ¢ge. Ms. Binoche plays Anna, a Frenchwoman who lives on an estate that belonged to her former husbandâ€™s family. Ms. de LaÃ¢ge is Jeanne, the French girlfriend of Annaâ€™s son, Giuseppe. Jeanne, who has never met Anna, arrives for a visit at a tragically inconvenient moment. Giuseppe has just died in an accident â€” the first images in â€œLâ€™Attesaâ€ are of his funeral â€” and Anna is too distraught to break the news to Jeanne. When the young woman calls from the airport, Anna tells her that Giuseppe isnâ€™t home and dispatches the caretaker, Pietro (Giorgio Colangeli), to pick her up. â€œIâ€™m waiting for the right moment to tell her,â€ Anna tells her sister-in-law after Jeanne has stumbled downstairs into a houseful of black-clad mourners. But Annaâ€™s lie, initially a sin of omission, grows deeper, more complicated and more cruel as Jeanne hangs around, waiting for her lover to return and leaving plaintive messages on his cellphone. Anna listens to them, with what seems to be a complicated blend of masochism, jealousy and wishful thinking â€” as if the fact that someone believes her son is still alive might make him less dead. â€œLâ€™Attesa,â€ loosely based on a 1923 play by Luigi Pirandello called â€œThe Life I Gave You,â€ is a delicate, slightly artificial study in time and emotion. Its slow pace captures the stasis of Annaâ€™s condition, her feeling of being stuck in an agonizing limbo between denial and acceptance. Jeanneâ€™s presence is both an unbearable reminder of her own loss and a token of her sonâ€™s presence, and Mr. Messina is more interested in the nuances of the situation than in the mechanics of plot. At times the plausibility of the story starts to fray, but the feelings and images are strong enough to keep such doubts in check. The setting has an atavistic, primal grandeur. Sicily is a place of ancient blood feuds, medieval rituals and Greek tragedies. And there is something similarly timeless about the contours of Ms. Binocheâ€™s face. In anguish and repose, Anna could be a figure in an Italian Renaissance painting, a pale image of sorrow against a dark background. Jeanne, first seen in the blinding, sterile light of the airport, can seem as much a time traveler as a tourist, a visitor from the European modernity that is also Annaâ€™s native realm. She comes to regard her would-be mother-in-law â€” thereâ€™s no real word for what they are to each other â€” as a wise aunt or an older sister, and despite the weirdness of the circumstances, the two women strike up a tentative friendship. Itâ€™s a pleasure to watch Ms. Binoche and Ms. de LaÃ¢ge onscreen together. And there are scenes of each of them alone that are piercing and lovely. At one point, Anna wraps her arms around an inflatable raft and releases the valve, catching her sonâ€™s preserved breath on her face as it escapes. â€œLâ€™Attesa,â€ while it is about the stasis and confinement of its characters, suffers from a different kind of claustrophobia. A model of craft, refinement and visual decorum, it is both a hothouse flower and a cinematic hothouse, nurturing blossoms of exquisite feeling protected from the air of reality. Compared, say, with the Sicily of Michelangelo Antonioniâ€™s â€œLâ€™Avventuraâ€ or (to take a more recent example, also starring Ms. Binoche) the Alps of Olivier Assayasâ€™s â€œClouds of Sils Maria,â€ Mr. Messinaâ€™s Sicily has the shallow picturesqueness of a tourist destination. And Annaâ€™s house, a stately pile of stones, is little more than an impressive piece of real estate, haunted not by history but by a single ghost. The performances are vivid and moving, but there is ultimately less to this well-made, impeccably acted film than meets the eye. Its meticulousness is to some degree a flaw, an evasion of nearly every variety of human messiness. You wait in vain for the full weight of bereavement to become apparent, and also for an indication of the density of experience. You wait in gorgeous surroundings, in marvelous company, for something that never arrives. â€œLâ€™Attesaâ€ (â€œThe Waitâ€) is not rated. It is in Italian and French, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes.]]></videosynposis>

		<videosynposis><![CDATA[You already know the big scenes will be awe-inspiring in â€œA Beautiful Planetâ€ â€” how can your eyes not bug out when given 3-D views of Earth, taken from space, on a stories-high Imax screen? Whatâ€™s surprising is how enjoyable the small moments are in this documentary, filmed aboard the International Space Station. Directed by Toni Myers and made in cooperation with NASA, most of â€œA Beautiful Planetâ€ was shot by astronauts while on monthslong space missions. From the space station they carried out research and space-walked to make needed repairs. And through it all, they took videos of our planet. To see vast oceans, immense deserts and mountain ranges from so high up is both humbling and inspiring. And scenes of mighty lightning storms, the aurora borealis and cities illuminated at night are magnificent. Just as fun is observing the astronauts as they handle seemingly simple tasks while weightless. A crew member floating as she sleeps looks supernatural; seeing another getting in and out of his spacesuit has a Marx Brothers-like quality. And I can say without reservation that Iâ€™ve never been so fascinated by watching a man shampoo his hair. Ms. Myers is an efficient director and editor, though her script could have used a few more of those personal moments to prevent viewer fatigue that may set in after the succession of huge images. Additional specifics on the missions and the science would also have been helpful. Still, this film, which is smoothly narrated by Jennifer Lawrence, finds a nice balance: Itâ€™s appealing to adults and accessible to younger viewers. And it delivers an environmental message that is strong and serious while remaining encouraging and optimistic. Thatâ€™s important to hear. The rest is just amazing to watch.]]></videosynposis>

		<videosynposis><![CDATA[The cinema of seduction doesnâ€™t get much more overheated than â€œA Bigger Splash,â€ an Italian come-on that doesnâ€™t just want to amuse you, but also to pour you a Negroni before taking you for a midnight spin with the top down. Set on an Italian island slithering with snakes and beautiful people, the movie is something of a reluctant thriller about a rock star, her current lover, her former lover and a pretty young thing. Bad things happen, because, you know, life is pain â€” in the meantime, though, do enjoy the magnificent digs, the designer threads and the frolicking nude stars. The last time the director Luca Guadagnino trained his sights on Tilda Swinton, she was suffering under the Milanese sun in â€œI Am Love,â€ playing an unhappy wife fluttering in a gilded cage. This time, Ms. Swinton plays a rock star, Marianne Lane, who shortly after â€œA Bigger Splashâ€ opens, is sunbathing au naturel next to a pool, as her lover, Paul (Matthias Schoenaerts), dozes nearby. Theyâ€™re a delectable pair of sexy beasts, ensconced on a jaw-slackening compound on Pantelleria, a volcanic island in the strait of Sicily thatâ€™s within viewing distance of Tunisia. Marianne has recently had career-lengthening throat surgery, a procedure thatâ€™s rendered her near-speechless. With her preternatural stillness and sculptured hauteur, Ms. Swinton has always looked ready for her close-up with D. W. Griffith; few contemporary movie actresses can hold you with their gaze as effortlessly as she does. Marianneâ€™s radio silence is a storytelling contrivance (for personal reasons, Ms. Swinton agreed to appear in the movie if she didnâ€™t speak), but it adds to the characterâ€™s celebrity aura and deepens the sense of isolation conveyed by the location. And while Marianne whispers when she feels like it, her relative silence works both for Ms. Swinton â€” it draws you closer to her â€” and for Mr. Guadagnino, a voluptuary who revels in the surface beauty of the natural and unnatural worlds. Marianne and Paulâ€™s private bliss-out is disrupted by the unexpected arrival of an old friend, a music producer, Harry (a sensational Ralph Fiennes), a motormouth who roars in with his daughter, Penelope (Dakota Johnson). Sheâ€™s recently learned that Harry is her father and now, for reasons that thicken the mystery, he has dragged her to Pantelleria without a hotel reservation, which is how they end up crashing at Marianne and Paulâ€™s hideaway. There, with icy and warm chatter flowing on rivers of booze, the characters circle one another as Mr. Guadagnino, working from David Kajganichâ€™s script, fills in the background with wayward looks, wanton caresses and flashbacks. â€œA Bigger Splashâ€ is based on Jacques Derayâ€™s 1969 film â€œLa Piscineâ€ (â€œThe Swimming Poolâ€), one of those idle-rich soaps in which trouble pulls up in a Maserati. A few years ago, the luxury-goods company Christian Dior recycled images of that filmâ€™s heartthrob attraction, Alain Delon, in an ad campaign for its cologne Eau Sauvage that used the Rolling Stonesâ€™ â€œSympathy for the Devil.â€ The playlist for â€œA Bigger Splashâ€ includes a couple of Stones songs as well, notably â€œEmotional Rescue,â€ which is in rotation with Harry Nilsson, Giuseppe Verdi, 1970s Brazilian classics and Hollywoodâ€™s eternal bad boy Robert Mitchum murdering the calypso ditty â€œBeauty Is Only Skin Deep.â€ Mr. Guadagnino, in other words, knows how to decorate a movie, from Marianneâ€™s manicured head to Penelopeâ€™s perfectly photographed bellybutton. Every fetishized element â€” the glorious house, the tiled pool, Marianneâ€™s Dior outfits and the scrubbiest of vistas â€” looks ravishing, ready for a close-up, too. The world that Mr. Guadagnino creates is at once seductive and aspirational, and another reminder that movies have always excelled at stoking consumer desires. Much like Nancy Meyers (â€œThe Internâ€), Mr. Guadagnino excels at creating lifestyle pornography of an especially rarefied kind, although in classic European style, he gilds the pleasure with some political guilt. Not too much, mind you, just enough to give the whole thing a patina of seriousness. Much like the faded hammer-and-sickle tattoo embellishing Harryâ€™s oft-bared chest, the movieâ€™s politics come across as self-consciously ornamental. At times, as with the topical references to refugees (a few of whom are seen huddled in detention), these glimpses of the larger, agonizing world are clearly meant to say something about the characters and their insularity. Mr. Guadagnino may be actually trying to assuage his conscience (or ours), as if to do penance for all this careless opulence. Yet these moments register as ritualistic at best, opportunistic at worst, and you wish he wouldnâ€™t even bother. Consciously or not, Mr. Guadagnino makes a more convincing political case when he just lets his characters meander and do what they do best, which is living idly, fabulously. You could read an entire history of civilization and capitalism in how Marianne drapes her legs across a lounger or strides into a humble Italian home to sample some homemade ricotta. Ms. Swinton conveys casual entitlement like someone to the manner born, which gives Marianneâ€™s teasing exchanges with Harry an increasingly discomfiting quality. Harry has come to the island for something he feverishly wants and believes he needs. Heâ€™s a man on a desperate mission, one that Mr. Fiennes, with a wildly flapping mouth and manic limbs, turns into a raw, indelible portrait of loss. â€œA Bigger Splashâ€ is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Adults behaving like adults, only naughtier and far nastier. Running time: 2 hours 4 minutes.]]></videosynposis>
